## 1. OBSERVATION: REGULATORY COMPLEXITY AS AN OBSTACLE

### Growing and multidimensional complexity

The building and urban planning sector faces an explosion of regulatory complexity:

- **Massive volume**: Codes, standards, reference frameworks, certifications, local regulations
- **Multiple sources**: Legislation, standardization bodies, private labels, local authorities
- **Constant evolution**: Frequent updates, new regulations, structural changes
- **Overlapping requirements**: Mandatory, voluntary, local, sectoral
- **New ESG dimensions**: Carbon, biodiversity, social, resilience, circularity

### Critical consequences

This complexity generates:

- **Difficulty in expressing needs**: How to define what is required/desired?
- **Design obstacles**: How to integrate all constraints?
- **Non-compliance risks**: How to ensure all rules are followed?
- **Arbitration challenges**: How to evaluate impacts (cost, value, ESG)?
- **Traceability problems**: How to justify regulatory choices?

### Inadequacy of current approaches

Traditional methods show their limits:

- **Documentary approach**: Text search, impossible to leverage all rules
- **Fragmented expertise**: Silos between technical and regulatory specialists
- **Proprietary tools**: Closed solutions, limited to certain domains
- **Lack of strategic vision**: Difficulties in simulating different regulatory scenarios
- **Standardization deficit**: No shared common model to structure this knowledge

---

## 2. VISION: AN OPEN SOURCE DIGITAL COMMONS

### A structural and collective response

EXCODE proposes a radically new approach:

- **A digital commons**: Shared resource, accessible to all, collectively enriched
- **Open source**: Code, data, and methodology freely available and modifiable
- **Collective intelligence**: Combination of AI and community expert validation
- **Systematic structuring**: Transformation of regulatory texts into structured databases
- **Horizontal approach**: Collaboration between experts, students, academics, professionals

### Founding principles

EXCODE is based on three key principles:

1. **Dissociation and standardization**: Modular separation of different levels of information (requirements, capabilities, impacts)

2. **AI augmented by human expertise**: AI proposes, humans validate and improve the AI

3. **Consensus-based governance**: Protection against manipulation through collective validation mechanisms

### Transformative objectives

EXCODE aims to:

- **Democratize** access to regulatory intelligence
- **Accelerate** the design of compliant and innovative buildings
- **Optimize** trade-offs between compliance, cost, and value
- **Facilitate** the evaluation of economic and ESG impacts
- **Anticipate** regulatory changes and their consequences

### Inspiring analogies

The project is inspired by three proven models:

- **Wikipedia**: Collaborative production of a digital commons through distributed contribution
- **GitHub**: Version management, traceable contributions and modifications
- **Blockchain**: Consensus mechanisms for reliable collective validation

## 3. ONTOLOGY: MODELING REQUIREMENTS AND CAPABILITIES

### A structuring ontology

The EXCODE ontology precisely defines concepts and their relationships:

```

### Fundamental concepts

**1. Normative sources**
- Regulatory texts, standards, and reference frameworks containing requirements
- Hierarchized according to their legal force (law, code, decree, standard, label)

**2. Requirements**
- Obligations that must be satisfied, derived from normative sources
- Divided into mandatory requirements (regulatory) and voluntary (certifications)
- Associated with contextual triggers defining their applicability

**3. Capabilities**
- Abilities necessary to satisfy requirements
- Can be static (passive characteristics) or dynamic (active processes)

**4. Static capabilities**
- Based on attributes (elementary properties)
- Verified by tangible evidence (documents, certifications)

**5. Dynamic capabilities**
- Based on functions (elementary operations)
- Associated with data points (measurements, states)

### Justification for the ontology

This advanced structuring allows:

- **Decomposition** of complex requirements into atomic elements
- **Traceability** from obligation to proof
- **Reusability** of capabilities to satisfy different requirements
- **Interoperability** between different reference frameworks and standards
- **Adaptability** to all types of buildings and contexts
- **Scalability** to integrate future regulatory concepts

## 4. ARCHITECTURE: INTERCONNECTED MODULAR DATABASES

### Modular database architecture

EXCODE is based on a structure of distinct but interconnected databases:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                STANDARDIZED DATABASES                        │

```

### Principle of modularity and linking tables

The system is based on:

- **Standardized databases** for each type of element (triggers, capabilities, impacts...)
- **Linking tables** connecting these elements via their identifiers

Example of a relationship:
```
Requirement (R142-12) --linked to--> Standardized trigger (D-001: "Heating_System_Present")
Requirement (R142-12) --requires--> Standardized capability (C-123: "Temperature regulation")
```

### Advantages of this modular architecture

1. **Independent update cycles**
   - Requirements evolve at the pace of regulations
   - Economic impacts can be updated separately
   - Technical capabilities remain relatively stable

2. **Simplified maintenance**
   - Modification of one database without impacting others
   - Targeted updates (e.g., costs only)
   - Independent versioning by database

3. **Optimal reuse**
   - The same trigger can serve numerous requirements
   - The same capability can satisfy different reference frameworks
   - Drastic reduction in redundancy

4. **Usage flexibility**
   - Possibility to use EXCODE without certain modules (e.g., without impacts)
   - Geographic adaptation (e.g., different impact databases by country)
   - Possible specialized extensions

## 5. PROCESS: COLLABORATIVE AI AND HUMAN VALIDATION

### AI Production + Human Validation + AI Improvement

The core of EXCODE is a cyclical process where AI and humans continuously collaborate:

```
┌─────────────┐     ┌───────────────┐     ┌────────────────┐
│  AI         │     │  Human        │     │  Weighted      │
│  Extraction │────►│  Validators   │────►│  Consensus     │
└─────────────┘     └───────────────┘     └────────────────┘
       ▲                    │                     │
       │                    │                     │
       └────────────────────┘                    │
       Feedback for         │                    │
       AI improvement       │                    │
                           │                    │
                           └────────────────────┘
                         Validated database
```

### Step-by-step extraction process

For each level of the ontology, the process follows a similar sequence:

**1. First-level AI extraction (sources → requirements)**
- AI analyzes regulatory texts and references
- Extraction of distinct requirements
- Detection of applicability triggers
- Classification (mandatory/voluntary, levels)
- Verification of existing similar requirements

**2. Collaborative human validation**
- Regulatory experts verify the extraction
- Adjustment of texts and classifications
- Validation of triggers
- Weighted consensus for acceptance

**3. Feedback and AI improvement**
- Capture of human corrections
- Analysis of error patterns
- Adjustment of extraction models
- Continuous improvement through learning

**4. Second-level AI extraction (requirements → capabilities)**
- AI analyzes validated requirements
- Identification of required capabilities
- Static/dynamic distinction
- Proposal of new capabilities or links to existing ones

**5. Technical validation by experts**
- Technical experts validate the decomposition
- Adjustment of identified capabilities
- Validation of requirement-capability links
- Enrichment of descriptions

**6. Continuation of the top-down process**
- Extraction of functions/attributes from capabilities
- Extraction of data points/proofs
- Validation at each level by specialized experts
- Constant feedback for AI improvement

### Standardization and verification mechanism

For each element proposed by the AI:

```
┌───────────────────────┐          ┌───────────────────────┐
│ EXTRACTION PROCESS    │          │  STANDARDIZED BASE    │

└───────────────────────┘                                    
```

1. AI proposes an element (trigger, capability, impact...)
2. The system checks if it already exists in the standardized database
3. If new: human validation then addition to standardized database
4. In all cases: creation of a link in the linking table

---

## 6. TRIGGERS: CONTEXTUALIZING REQUIREMENTS

### Concept and utility of triggers

Triggers are contextual conditions that determine the applicability of a requirement:

**Definition**: Conditions that activate or deactivate the applicability of a requirement in a specific context

**Function**: Allow external platforms to query EXCODE to obtain only relevant requirements for a given project

**Structure**: Logical combinations (AND, OR, NOT) of standardized elementary conditions

### Main types of triggers

1. **Verification event triggers**
   - Project initialization (first complete verification)
   - Significant modifications requiring re-verification:
     - Addition of a floor
     - Surface modification
     - Change of use
     - Structural transformation
     - Integration of new technical systems

2. **Typological triggers**
   - Building type (public access building, housing, offices, industrial...)
   - Specific category (school, hospital, commercial...)
   - Classification (height, occupancy, surface area...)

3. **Geographic triggers**
   - Climate zone
   - Seismic zone
   - Department/region
   - Urban/rural area

4. **Technical triggers**
   - Presence of specific systems
   - Materials used
   - Equipment installed

5. **Functional triggers**
   - Intended use of spaces
   - Type of activity
   - Occupant profile

### Structuring of triggers

Example of a logical combination for a requirement:

```
Requirement R142-12 applies IF:
    (Verification = Initialization OR Verification = Technical_System_Modification)
    AND (System_Present = Heating)
    AND (Building_Type = All)
```

### Standardized trigger database

The standardization of triggers allows their reuse across different requirements:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "D-001",
    "type": "verification",
    "value": "Initialization",
    "description": "First verification of the project"
  },
  {
    "id": "D-002",
    "type": "system",
    "value": "Heating_System_Present",
    "description": "Presence of a heating system"
  },
  {
    "id": "D-003",
    "type": "building",
    "value": "Public_Access_Building",
    "description": "Building Receiving the Public"
  }
]
```

### Requirements-triggers linking table

```json
[
  {
    "requirement_id": "R142-12",
    "trigger_id": "D-001",
    "operator": "OR"
  },
  {
    "requirement_id": "R142-12",
    "trigger_id": "D-002",
    "operator": "AND"
  }
]
```

---

## 7. IMPACTS: MULTIDIMENSIONAL EVALUATION

### Concept and utility of impacts

Impacts are multidimensional evaluations of the consequences related to implementing a requirement:

**Definition**: Economic, environmental, social, or value-related consequences associated with a requirement

**Function**: Allow the simulation of regulatory trade-offs and optimization of strategic choices

**Structure**: Divided into distinct databases by impact type, associated with requirements via linking tables

### Impact dimensions

1. **Economic impact (impact_cost)**
   - Estimation of additional investment or operational cost
   - Expressed in absolute, relative value, or by building typology
   - Example: "+15 €/m² for SmartScore compliance on fiber cabling"

2. **ESG impact (impact_ESG)**
   - Expected or typical values of impact on ESG criteria
   - Environmental, social, and governance indicators
   - Example: "-12% CO₂ emissions", "+2 accessibility points"

3. **Value impact (impact_value)**
   - Potential gain in financial value, usage, or differentiation
   - Indicators of property valuation or functional improvement
   - Example: "+1 star on HQE label", "+5% market value"

4. **Time impact (impact_time)**
   - Estimation of the impact on project duration or phase
   - Anticipation of time constraints
   - Example: "additional 3-week delay", "must be anticipated in sketch phase"

5. **Certification impact (impact_score)**
   - Points awarded in each compatible reference framework or label
   - Contribution to certification objectives
   - Example: "SmartScore Silver = 4 points", "HQE Operations = 2 credits"

### Dissociated impact databases

Each type of impact is managed in a separate database, allowing independent updates:

```json
// Cost impact database
[
  {
    "id": "IC-001",
    "value": "15€/m²",
    "range": "12-18€/m²",
    "unit": "€/m²",
    "source": "CSTB 2024",
    "update_date": "2024-05-01",
    "reliability": "high"
  }
]

// ESG impact database
[
  {
    "id": "IRSE-001",
    "carbon": "-12%/year",
    "comfort": "+2 points",
    "source": "ADEME 2024",
    "update_date": "2024-04-15",
    "reliability": "medium"
  }
]
```

### Requirements-impacts linking table

```json
[
  {
    "requirement_id": "R142-12",
    "impact_id": "IC-001",
    "context": "New commercial building",
    "comment": "Valid for areas >1000m²"
  },
  {
    "requirement_id": "R142-12",
    "impact_id": "IRSE-001",
    "context": "Standard",
    "comment": "Average observed across 50 buildings"
  }
]
